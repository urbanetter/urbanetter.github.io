As a web architect and part of the frontend team at Swiss Radio and Television, Urban Etter tries to strike a balance between spending time with his two lovely daughters and fulfilling his other passion: the web. Since he started in the web business more than a decade ago, he continues to be amazed by the possibilities the web has to offer. He enjoys exploring new technologies and frameworks and sharing his experiences with his fellow developers.
